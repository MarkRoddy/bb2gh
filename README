bb2gh - Light weight mirroring of your public bitbucket projects to github


All you need is:
* curl
* git (with your ssh key configured)
* hg (only if you hg bitbucket repos)


usage:
1) Create an empty repo on github for each of your public bitbucket repo, to
see a list of these repos, run:
> bb2gh -l bitbucket-user-name

2) Run the replication:
> bb2gh bitbucket-user-name [github-user-name]

Note that for the sake of repo identification, github user names are case sensative.
